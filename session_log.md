# Session Log

This file tracks every session's contributions and links to the full audit transcript. Contribution entries must never be compressed or summarized away.

## Session 1 — 2026-02-26 (Bootstrap)

**Audit file**: [`session_audits/2026-02-26_09-35-00_a96855ed_session-0-bootstrap.jsonl`](session_audits/2026-02-26_09-35-00_a96855ed_session-0-bootstrap.jsonl)

| # | Who | Contribution |
|---|-----|-------------|
| 1 | Human | Provided initial prompt defining the project vision: a canvas-based presentation with scripted walkthroughs, interactive focus elements, modern minimalist design, and parallax generative backgrounds. Defined documentation structure and contribution logging requirements. |
| 2 | Claude | Created project scaffolding: `initial_prompt.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `project_info.md`, `technical_info.md`, `design_guide.md`, `key_decisions.md`, `key_learnings.md`. Initialized git repository and made initial commit. |
| 3 | Human | Requested automatic session audit logging — full transcripts (including thinking steps) saved to `session_audits/`, one file per session, structured JSONL, committed to git. |
| 4 | Claude | Implemented session audit system: `.claude/hooks/audit-session.py` (copies full transcript on Stop/SessionEnd), `.claude/settings.json` (project-level hooks config), `session_audits/` directory. Updated `.gitignore` for temp markers. |

## Session 2 — 2026-02-26

**Audit file**: [`session_audits/2026-02-26_10-19-14_807796bc.jsonl`](session_audits/2026-02-26_10-19-14_807796bc.jsonl)

| # | Who | Contribution |
|---|-----|-------------|
| 5 | Human | Clarified session logging: session logs should live in `session_log.md` (not CLAUDE.md) and link to the respective session audit files. Renamed file from `session_summary.md` to `session_log.md`. |
| 6 | Claude | Created `session_log.md` with per-session contributions linking to audit files. Added "Session logging" convention to `CLAUDE.md`. |
| 7 | Human | Pointed out contribution log should not remain in `CLAUDE.md`. |
| 8 | Claude | Removed contribution log from `CLAUDE.md`, moved full contribution tables into `session_log.md` as the single source of truth. |
| 9 | Human | Asked about inconsistent audit file naming (`_session-0-bootstrap` suffix vs auto-generated names). |
| 10 | Claude | Explained the bootstrap file was a manual snapshot; all future files follow the hook's `{timestamp}_{8-char-id}.jsonl` pattern. |
| 11 | Human | Asked when `session_log.md` gets updated — suggested a `/logsession` command to run at end of session. Confirmed retrospective logging from audits is fine. |
| 12 | Claude | Created `.claude/commands/logsession.md` custom command. Updated `CLAUDE.md` convention to reference `/logsession`. |
| 13 | Human | Asked about hooking into `/clear` to auto-run `/logsession`. |
| 14 | Claude | Explained no hook exists for `/clear`; audit files serve as safety net for missed logging. |

## Session 3 — 2026-02-26

**Audit file**: [`session_audits/2026-02-26_10-53-57_070261de.jsonl`](session_audits/2026-02-26_10-53-57_070261de.jsonl)

| # | Who | Contribution |
|---|-----|-------------|
| 15 | Human | Updated `CLAUDE.md` to add a Git Use section with commit conventions: commit frequently in meaningful batches, commit session_audits separately and only for concluded sessions. |
| 16 | Human | Requested augmenting `/logsession` to automatically commit concluded session audit files. |
| 17 | Claude | Updated `.claude/commands/logsession.md` with step 6: after logging, scan `session_audits/` for `.jsonl` files, check for active `.start` markers by matching 8-char IDs to UUID prefixes, and commit all concluded audits in a single separate commit. |
| 18 | Human | Asked how two session audits can be active simultaneously. |
| 19 | Claude | Identified three `.start` files: two stale orphans (from crashed/killed sessions) and the current session. Explained that `.start` files linger when the cleanup hook doesn't fire. |
| 20 | Human | Chose to add stale-detection logic to `/logsession` rather than manual cleanup. |
| 21 | Claude | Added stale-detection step to `/logsession`: before committing, identify stale `.start` files by checking if their `.jsonl` is missing or unmodified for 10+ minutes, then auto-delete them so the commit logic picks up newly-concluded audits. |
